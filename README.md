## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

cd your-repository
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Appwrite configuration variables. You can refer to the `.env.example` file if available.

Example `.env.local`:
